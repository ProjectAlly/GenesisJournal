		<b>ABSTRACT:</b><br/>	 
			A sensitive, selective and validated first derivative spectrophotometric method using methanol have been proposed
			for the determination of Acebrophylline which is widely used as anti asthmatic agent. The developed
			spectrophotometric method is simple, rapid, precise, accurate, reliable and economical. Method is specific in presence of
			Ambroxol which is the impurity of Acebrophyllin. The method is accurate, precise and linear over a range of 5-50μg/ml for
			Acebrophyllin. The limit of detection was observed as 0.178μg /ml, the limit of quantification was observed as 0.598μg/ml.
			The %RSD is less than 2% in methanol. Method accurately estimates Acebrophyllin in presence of Ambroxol with 99-100%
			recovery. The method can be applied for Acebrophylline tablet formulation with 99-100% recovery.
